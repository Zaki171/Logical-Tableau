# Logical-Tableau
Here we have a program that can parse logical and first-order formulas and decide whether they are satisfiable or not. For instance, -(p>p) (not p implies p) is not satisfiable because p always implies p, but (pvq) is satisfiable as there exists a valuation where p or q holds. The program decides which is satisfiable by constructing a tableau. This is a tree-like structure that breaks down the formulas until they are literals and decides satisfiability based on whether any contradictions have been found (eg. having a p and a -p in the same branch). If there are no contradictions the formula is satisfiable. First-order formulas are more complex, as they use E (there exists) and A(for all), which can lead to a tableau that goes on forever. As a result if the tableau has to introduce more than 10 constants it stops and returns an ambigious message.
